# chaos-pendulum
An educational demonstration of the double pendulum producing chaos

## For the Montshire Science Museum...

This is an attempt to develop a science museum physical exhibit to teach kids about mathematical chaos and the regularity of 
a pendulum.  As such, it is interactive, but may seem a bit weird if the user imagines a computer-only simulation.

You probably want to go to the [simulation itself](http://pubinv.github.io/chaos-pendulum/).
